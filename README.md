# Training of Personality Trait Model for Predicting Places of Visit

## Course Code: CS867	<br/>
## Course Project	<br/>

### Overview		<br/>
Problem of predicting likely places of visit of users using their generated content on Twitter considering the past tweets and additional constraints such as the time of visit, geo-spatial range, previous visited location, personality traits are resolved [1]. Further, solution is able to solve cold start problem for new users. This repository contains an implementation (can be provided on request) and results of such predictions using python [2].
